# Some Tips & Tricks
1. Did you know?
   - You can launch 40 Firework OR Fireball OR DeathBat attacks at once targeting to a single bot. Wondering How?
   - In Cheat Engine, set up hotkeys, and set any two hotkeys to "Set Speedhack to 0.01" & "Set Speedhack to 1" respectively
   - Now, check the button on Cheat Engine "Enable Speedhack" available on your right side
   - Enter any race on any game
   - Gain a powerup that doesn't have a heavy animation effects. Eg: Firework, Fireball, DeathBat etc
   - Activate Infinite Powerup Using "Shift" Key
   - Now, Identify Your Target and Press the Hotkey To "Set Speedhack to 0.01"
   - Now, Click Space To Activate Your Powerup But, Do This 40 Times
   - Now, Press the Hotkey To "Set Speedhack to 1"
   - Enjoy The Scenery
2. Did you know?
   - The game uses boolean values "True" & "False" in 4 bytes to activate abilities like: Power, Powerups etc
   - In boolean value, "True" is considered 1 & "False" is considered 0
   - Hence, finding values like Boost, Shield Effect, Police Chase, Big Tires, Angry Bull is pretty easy
   - If you find one, you can freeze your value to 1 i.e ALWAYS ON, and enjoy the effects
   - Just don't try to turn this into a script because if you do, it will apply the same effects to everyone
3. Did you know?
   - Why does changing a certain value into a script cause everyone to gain the same effects?
   - It is because, everyone in the racing field share the same class
   - Since everyone has the same class, they also share the same variable
   - Hence, changing that variable will apply its effects to everyone
   - To make a script that will identify you and others, you need to learn about commonalities in Cheat Engine
   - Having some knowledge of OOP will also give you a understanding of why...

# How to use the mod?

1. _Download Cheat Engine from the following link_
  https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php
  ![Capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c4affdb-5a79-4ed4-9491-235822db1f09)


2. _Immediately after download, your system will detect Cheat Engine as a virus. But it is completely safe unless you try to manipulate some system level applications which I believe is also not authorized to Cheat Engine. So, you need to click on the notification which will open "Settings" App on your system_

3. _Go to your Downloads Directory or Simply your Downloads on Chrome. If you still didn't understand, simply click "Ctrl+J" to open Download History on your Chrome Browser. There, you can see the Cheat Engine Executable. Simply Click on it once_

4. _Now, a install window will open. Click OK and there's one crucial step for you to remember. The executable file will try to request you to install an anti-virus software which you shouldn't accept. Remember, don't click "Accept" || Instead, click "Skip All"_
