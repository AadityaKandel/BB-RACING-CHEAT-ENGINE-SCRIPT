# How to use the mod?

1. _Download Cheat Engine from the following link_
  https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php
  ![Capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c4affdb-5a79-4ed4-9491-235822db1f09)


2. _Immediately after download, your system will detect Cheat Engine as a virus. But it is completely safe unless you try to manipulate some system level applications which I believe is also not authorized to Cheat Engine. So, you need to click on the notification which will open "Settings" App on your system_

3. _Go to your Downloads Directory or Simply your Downloads on Chrome. If you still didn't understand, simply click "Ctrl+J" to open Download History on your Chrome Browser. There, you can see the Cheat Engine Executable. Simply Click on it once_

4. _Now, a install window will open. Click OK and there's one crucial step for you to remember. The executable file will try to request you to install an anti-virus software which you shouldn't accept. Remember, don't click "Accept" || Instead, click "Skip All"_
