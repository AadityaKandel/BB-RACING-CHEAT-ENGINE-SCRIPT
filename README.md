# BB-RACING-CHEAT-ENGINE-SCRIPT
This is the first script of Beach Buggy Racing with 15 mods. These mods are designed to level up your playing field in the game with an unfair yet enjoyable advantage to your player.

# MOD DESCRIPTION & GUIDE
I will only mention such mods which require you an additional step to do in the game to enable it.

GOD MODE

To enable this mode, you need to own "Ghost" or "Mcskelly" Character. If you don't know how to own him without Dueling him, you can simply head to "QUICK RACE" || Then, you can select the map & while selecting the character, you can buy him using Diamonds

Now, all you need to do is this. Enable GOD MODE while playing the race or not, The cheat works either way. Play a race. There, you'll see that your "Msckelly Ability" or "Player Ability" will fill up instantly. Like very very fast. You can click "A" on your keyboard to activate the ability. Then, you are invulnerable the entire race.
Don't worry! Once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly easy and trust me; it won't be a boring step. Other things are explained below: If you've already installed cheat engine, you can skip to "Step 5" [ENJOY!!]

# How to use the mod?

Step 1: Download Cheat Engine from the following link
https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php

Step 2: Immediately after download, your system will detect Cheat Engine as a virus. But it is completely safe unless you try to manipulate some system level applications which I believe is also not authorized to Cheat Engine. So, you need to click on the notification which will open "Settings" App on your system.

Step 3: Go to your Downloads Directory or Simply your Downloads on Chrome. If you still didn't understand, simply click "Ctrl+J" to open Download History on your Chrome Browser. There, you can see the Cheat Engine Executable. Simply Click on it once.

Step 4: Now, a install window will open. Click OK and there's one crucial step for you to remember. The executable file will try to request you to install an anti-virus software which you shouldn't accept. Remember, don't click "Accept" || Instead, click "Skip All"

Step 5: Now, Cheat Engine will proceed to install itself. After that, you can open the game "Beach Buggy Racing" || Wait till the game loads and double click on the script I gave you.


Step 6: After double clicking the script, Cheat Engine will automatically load it for you. However, you need to select the process by your own. To do that follow the screenshot below:
